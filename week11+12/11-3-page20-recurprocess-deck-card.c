/*
Exercise: Recursive Processing
• Write a recursive algorithm for dealing a deck of
cards. The parameters should be (i) the deck of
undealt cards, and (ii) the person who is to
receive the next card. Assume:
• the players are seated around a table;
• dealing begins with the player to the dealer’s left;
• each dealing step involves dealing one card to a
player, then the dealer’s attention moves to the
next player to the left; and
• dealing continues until no cards are left in the
deck.
